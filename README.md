# BreadBotForDiscord Bot Template
Click [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications) to go to the Discord Developer Portal and make a new discord bot, name it bread.bot, and make the description:
my discord bot named bread.bot, but i made this on e in python
Use "!cmds" or "!bakerymenu" to see the commands
made by @Hello12231223 on discord
made by the-awesome-noob on github (github.com/the-awesome-noob)

If you dont want that as the description, thats fine, however do not remove my credit.
Download botgithubversion.py and requirements.txt from the latest release and then use that to make your bot work.
